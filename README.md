# Obsidian Vault

## Rules

1. No floaters, (at least) link *everything* back to the [Table of Links](README#Table of Links)
3. Other link hubs are okay
4. Use triple backticks and [GitHub syntax highlighting](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks#syntax-highlighting) for code blocks
5. If pasting YouTube videos, please use the embedded iframe with `Enable privacy-enhanced mode` checked using the share button
6. Git: Just fucking send it. Pull latest to a test branch if you're really worried about it.
7. Git messages: comma separated names of file/subject you added or changed at least; if lazy, just summarize
