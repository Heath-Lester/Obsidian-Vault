# Obsidian Vault

## How to Use

1. Go to and download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
2. Clone this repo
3. Start Obsidian and open your newly cloned repo with it
## Rules

1. Use triple backticks and [GitHub syntax highlighting](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks#syntax-highlighting) for code blocks
2. If pasting YouTube videos, please use the embedded iframe with `Enable privacy-enhanced mode` checked using the share button
3. Git: Just fucking send it. Pull latest to a test branch if you're really worried about it.
4. Git messages: comma separated names of file/subject you added or changed at least; if lazy, just summarize
