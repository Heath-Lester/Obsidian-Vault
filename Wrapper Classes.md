(Java) Wrapper classes are classes for primitive data types provided so as to be used as objects with their methods.

|Primitive Data Type|Wrapper Class|
|---|---|
|byte|Byte|
|short|Short|
|int|Integer|
|long|Long|
|float|Float|
|double|Double|
|boolean|Boolean|
|char|Character|

This essentially equivocates to JavaScript data type methods because primitive data types in Java do not have built-in methods.
