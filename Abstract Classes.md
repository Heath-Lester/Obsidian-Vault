An _abstract class_ is a class that is declared `abstract`â€”it may or may not include abstract methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed.

An _abstract method_ is a method that is declared without an implementation (without braces, and followed by a semicolon), like this:

abstract void moveTo(double deltaX, double deltaY);

If a class includes abstract methods, then the class itself _must_ be declared `abstract`, as in:

```java
public abstract class GraphicObject {
   // declare fields
   // declare nonabstract methods
   abstract void draw();
}
```


When an abstract class is subclassed, the subclass usually provides implementations for all of the abstract methods in its parent class. However, if it does not, then the subclass must also be declared `abstract`.
