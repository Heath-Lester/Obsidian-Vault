Assess Specifiers are common on object oriented languages. These specifiers control the scope of the variables and functions they describe. There are generally three types of specifiers:

- public - members are accessible
- private - members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class
- protected - members cannot be accessed from outside the class, however, they can be accessed in inherited classes

Modules also have access specifiers which are normally just exports:
 - export - members are importable from this module
 - export default - only this member is importable from this module
