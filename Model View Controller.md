Model View Controller is a design pattern normally utilized for developing user interfaces that segregates user input from the data and display with a controller.

For example Django professes to use a variation of the model view controller system calling an "MTV" where the controller is rather a template. 

In Django the model refers to the models used to the model classes used to define objects and instantiate SQL tables. The view is the view classes that are used as callback functions for particular URLs. The controller is the framework itself that facilitates the models and view.
