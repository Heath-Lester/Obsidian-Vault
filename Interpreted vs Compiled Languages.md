Interpreted languages need an interpreter that runs through each line of code and translates them a line at a time into binary so that the computer can run them. This interpreter is also known as an engine and the interpretation is also known as just-in-time compilation. (JIT)


Compiled languages need a compiler that converts all of the code into binary in the form of an executable file.
