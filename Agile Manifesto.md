## Manifesto for Agile Software Development

`We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:`

- `Individuals and interactions over processes and tools`
- `Working software over comprehensive documentation` 
- `Customer collaboration over contract negotiation`
- `Responding to change over following a plan`

`That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.`
