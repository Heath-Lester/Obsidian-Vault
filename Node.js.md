Node.js is a runtime environment for [[JavaScript]] using the [[V8]] JavaScript engine. This allows the building of standalone applications in JavaScript able to be run on any machine. The implication of this is that JavaScript applications are no longer exclusive to web browsers. This also enables the creation of cross-platform applications.

One of the major differences with Node.js from other runtime environments is it includes an HTTP module which allows it to be used as a server.
