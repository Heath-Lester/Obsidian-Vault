There are four pillars of object oriented design: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
1. [[Abstraction]]
	- hiding the internal details or process that are considered unnecessary
2. [[Encapsulation]]
	- process of organizing and separating code so that classes only contain code that is relevant to the feature or surrounding context
3. [[Inheritance]]
	- the inheritance of properties and methods to a class that extends or implements another class
4. [[Polymorphism]]
	- allows child classes to use different implementations of inherited methods by overriding them
