1. Partition state
	- "Divide state into smaller chunks to leverage parallelism of the system"

2. Communicate Facts
	- "Choose immutable event streams over mutable state"

3. Isolate Mutations
	- "Contain and isolate mutable state using bulkheads"

4. Coordinate Data-flow
	- "Orchestrate a continuous steady flow of information"

5. Localize State
	- "Take ownership of data by co-locating state and processing"

6. Observe Communications
	- "Understand your system by looking at its dynamics"
