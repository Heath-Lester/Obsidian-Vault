## Hash Map Utilizations & How to Think About Them

- two sum `{difference from the target value, index of the subtractor}`
- sliding window `{value, position}`

It seems as if there is a repeating relationship with the key, value paring in the map as a specific role to algorithms. Still narrowing down what that is.

Maybe this:

| Key   | Value       |                                                         |                                             |
| ----- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Goal  | Requirement | I need to find one of these goal with this requirement. | I have this goal, do you have the same one? |
| Thing | Position    | I have these things in these places.                    | Where is the place of that thing?           |
It seems as if this is a piece of a longer line of logical thought. I suppose the starting question is the better thought.

I think at the same time solutions tend to boil down to figuring out what the least number of things do you need to come to a solution are. This is what I find most difficult.


## How to Know How To Look At Things

There is always a linear solution. There is always a beginning, middle, and end. There is an exit, setup/staging, start/execution, running, re-prep/administrative/follow through, conditional ending, through ending.

## Questions

- What do I want to avoid?
- What is the absolute minimum that I need?
- What do I not need?
- How do I skip?
- How many points of contact do I need?
- How do I shift the points of contact the least?
- How do I get the most out of every single iteration?
- Can all the points of contact not move in a single iteration?
- Can I rotate the sequence of events so that the administrative tasks take place at the end
