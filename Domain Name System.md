A DNS is a database that contains public IP addresses associated to names. It allows servers to find IP addresses for websites and other forms of communication.

Another way to think of it is as a phone book for the internet.

| Website | IP |

| google.com | 8.8.8.8 |
| cloudflare.com | 1.1.1.1 |
| quad9.com | 9.9.9.9 |
| openDNS.com | 208.67.222.222 |
