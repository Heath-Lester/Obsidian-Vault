Scope, aka visibility, refers to the name binding of a variable or function within the context of where it is accessible within a  section of code.

The the purpose of limited scope is to prevent name collision by allowing names to refer to different objects within different sections of code.

Generally scope is divided into three categories, global, local, and block. Global scope generally refers to variables within a module. Local scope generally refers to variables a class or function. Block scope generally refers to variables within a statement or expression.
