TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

TypeScript is a language that is a _superset_ of JavaScript: JS syntax is therefore legal TS. Syntax refers to the way we write text to form a program. TypeScript is a _typed_ superset, meaning that it adds rules about how different kinds of values can be used.
