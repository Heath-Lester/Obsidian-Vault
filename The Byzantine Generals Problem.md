This problem was developed by **Marshall Pease, Robert Shostak, and Leslie Lamport developed the idea in 1982**. It is also known as the Byzantine fault and the Two Generals problem.

A Byzantine fault is any fault presenting different symptoms to different observers.[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault#cite_note-DriscollHall2004-3) A Byzantine failure is the loss of a system service due to a Byzantine fault in systems that require [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science) "Consensus (computer science)") among distributed nodes.[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault#cite_note-DriscollHall2003-4)

As an analogy of the fault's simplest form, consider a number of generals who are attacking a fortress. The generals must decide as a group whether to attack or retreat; some may prefer to attack, while others prefer to retreat. The important thing is that all generals agree on a common decision, for a halfhearted attack by a few generals would become a [rout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rout "Rout"), and would be worse than either a coordinated attack or a coordinated retreat.

>If all generals attack in coordination, the battle is won. If two generals falsely declare that they intend to attack, but instead retreat, the battle is lost
