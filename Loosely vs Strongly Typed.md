A strongly typed language ([[Java]], [[TypeScript]]) refers to a system checking an object type before an operation is executed, causing a compilation error or runtime error.

A loosely typed language ([[JavaScript]], Python) does not have this kind of checking which allows those errors to occur undetected by the compiler or interpreter.
