Big O notation is a formula used to measure the scalability of a function's usage of time or space.
- Time: Operations * elements
- Space: Storage * elements	

## Rules

1. Always use worst case
2. Remove constants
3. Different inputs should have different variables
4. Drop non-dominant terms

## Scalings

Eight types of Big O scalings from best to worst:
1. Constant Time		O(1)
2. Logarithmic Time	O(log n)
3. Linear Time		O(n)
4. Linearithmic Time	O(n log n)
5. Quadratic Time	O(n^2)
6. Cubic Time		O(n^3)
7. Exponential Time	O(2^n)
8. Factorial Time		O(!n)	

## Polynomial Time

Times where "n" is the base, as opposed to the exponent.
- Logarithmic Time		O(log n)
- Linear Time			O(n)
- Linearithmic Time		O(n log n) 
- Quadratic Time		O(n^2)
- Cubic Time			O(n^3)			

## Exponential Time

Times where "n" is the exponent:
- Exponential Time	O(2^n)
- Factorial time		O(!n)

## Logarithmic Time

Logarithmic Time is usually encountered in searches and binary tree traversals.
