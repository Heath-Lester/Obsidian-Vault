Scripting languages are non-compiled, aka interpreted, languages. They require an interpreter to compile the language into machine readable code just before the time of execution. This is also known as Just-in-time Compilation. See [[Interpreted vs Compiled Languages]].

| **Parameters**      | **Scripting Language**                                                                            | **Programming Language**                                                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Language Type       | The scripting languages are interpreter-based languages.                                          | The programming languages are compiler-based languages.                                                |
| Use                 | The scripting languages help in combining the existing components of an application.              | The programming languages help in developing anything from scratch.                                    |
| Running of Language | A user needs to run scripting languages inside an existing program. Thus, it’s program-dependent. | Programming languages are program-independent.                                                         |
| Conversion          | Scripting languages convert high-level instructions into machine language.                        | Programming languages help in converting the full program into the machine language (at once).         |
| Compilation         | You don’t need to compile these languages.                                                        | These languages first need a compilation.                                                              |
| Design              | These make the coding process simple and fast.                                                    | These provide full usage of the languages.                                                             |
| File Type           | Scripting languages don’t create any file types.                                                  | Programming languages create .exe files.                                                               |
| Complexity          | These are very easy to use and easy to write.                                                     | These are pretty complex in terms of writing and usage.                                                |
| Type of Coding      | Scripting languages help write a small piece of an entire code.                                   | Programming languages help write the full code concerning a program.                                   |
| Developing Time     | These take less time because they involve lesser code.                                            | These take more time because a programmer must write the entire code.                                  |
| Interpretation      | We usually interpret a scripting language in another program.                                     | The compile results of a programming language are stand-alone. No other program needs to interpret it. |
| Requirement of Host | Scripting languages require hosts for execution.                                                  | Programming languages are self-executable. They don’t require any host.                                |
| Length of Codes     | These involve very few and short coding lines.                                                    | These require numerous lines of coding for a single function.                                          |
| Support             | These provide limited support to data types, user interface design, and graphic design.           | These provide rich support for graphic design, data types, and user interface design.                  |
| Maintenance         | These involve very low maintenance.                                                               | These involve high maintenance.                                                                        |
| Cost                | It is easier and cheaper to maintain a scripting language.                                        | Maintaining a programming language is comparatively more expensive.                                    |
| Example             | VB Script, Perl, Ruby, PHP, [[JavaScript]], etc.                                                  | C, C++, COBOL, Basic, VB, C#, Pascal, [[Java]], etc.                                                   |
